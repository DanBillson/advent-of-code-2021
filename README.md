## Advent of Code 2021 - Rust

This is my first time using rust with an attempt at https://adventofcode.com/

My aim is to start of very simple and not try to do anything too fancy straight away and then if I feel like it I'll go back over previous attempts and neaten them up or provide different solutions.

Currently I am very much a javascript developer but I thought I'd try something a bit different.
